V_drift = +/- 6 nV/degC @ gain=128
FSV = 10,000 nV

Therefore F_drift = +/- 0.06 %FS/degC @ gain=128
@ FS=15kg=147.15N: 

F_drift = +/- 0.08829 N/degC

Half average temperature range for Christchurch in summer: 4.5 degC

F_drift = +/- 0.397305 N, on average

OR 

Full average temperature range for Christchurch in summer: 9 degC

F_drift = +/- 0.79461 N
